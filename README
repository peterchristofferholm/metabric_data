A slightly curated and processed version of the `METABRIC` dataset found on 
[`cBioPortal`](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=brca_metabric).
The code for querying `cBioPortal`, cleaning the clinical and mutation data,
preparing outcomes, and creating the test/train split is found in 
`create_files.R`.
